# Food Tracker

This is the final project for [learnjavascript.online](https://learnjavascript.online).

In this final project, I've reviewed the most important JavaScript concepts that I've learned in this course.

Here's a list of some of these topics:

- Data structures (numbers, strings, arrays, objects, arrays of objects) and their associated methods
- if conditions
- Iterations and Reduce
- Optional chaining & nullish coalescing
- Classes
- Fetch API and the FetchWrapper
- Modules & importing packages
- DOM (selection, events, etc.)
- Closures
- how to integrate two 3rd party libraries: snackbar and chart.js
- how to think about refactoring and DRY
- how to refactor duplicate code
- using classes to store application data/state
- work with a generic API (Firebase API)
